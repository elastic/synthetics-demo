## Get started with Elastic Synthetics!

### Do not copy this folder!

These files were generated with the command:

`npx @elastic/synthetics init <projectname>`

Rather than pull down this example it's a better idea to generate a fresh project yourself!

See the [Synthetics docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/master/monitor-uptime-synthetics.html) for more information.
